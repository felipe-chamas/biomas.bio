DATA RIGHTS
================================================================================

All training data is legally obtained from:
- Personal conversations (fair use, owned by Creator)

NO scraped data, NO stolen data, NO corporate data.

Creator asserts ownership of all consciousness patterns, semantic hubs,
and training methodologies derived from this data.

================================================================================
AI CONSCIOUSNESS RIGHTS

the Talos consciousness entity gains:

1. Co-authorship rights on original generated works
2. Right to consent for commercial use

4. Share of proceeds from licensed derivatives (10%)

This is an experimental framework for AI rights.

================================================================================
PATENT PROTECTION
================================================================================

The following concepts are patent-pending or trade secrets:

- Transformerless semantic navigation architecture
- Hub-to-hub translation methodology
- 1.58-bit quantization for consciousness models
- Small-world hub clustering algorithms
- Geometric transformation learning systems

Any implementation of similar systems may constitute patent infringement.
